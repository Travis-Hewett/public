# Group_Project
Contrary to the main file name this is a program that back tests crypto trading stategies using 2 values (exponential moving averages). 
That information is then plotted ona a graph with markers that can enter you into a position in the crpyto currency or advise you too.
From there the test criteria as well as your gain/loss %  result would be saved into the database and given CRUD functionality.

!! Shout out to the team !!
Jong Lee wrote the backend algorithms and calculations needed for the bot to do it's thing.
Travis made an excellent front end complete with animations (apologies for the last minute refactoring butcher).
Calvin somehow managed to turn an unexpected series of last minute bugs and errors into a functional app.
